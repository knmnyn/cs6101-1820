<p>This course is taken almost verbatim from <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n">CS 224N Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing</a> – <a href="http://socher.org">Richard Socher</a>’s course at Stanford. We are following their course’s formulation and selection of papers, with the permission of Socher.</p>

<p>This is a section of the CS 6101 Exploration of Computer Science Research at NUS. CS 6101 is a 4 modular credit pass/fail module for new incoming graduate programme students to obtain background in an area with an instructor’s support. It is designed as a “lab rotation” to familiarize students with the methods and ways of research in a particular research area.</p>

<p>Our section will be conducted as a group seminar, with class participants nominating themselves and presenting the materials and leading the discussion. It is not a lecture-oriented course and not as in-depth as Socher’s original course at Stanford, and hence is not a replacement, but rather a class to spur local interest in Deep Learning for NLP.</p>

<p>This course is offered twice, for Session I (Weeks 3-7) and Session II (Weeks 8-13), although it is clear that the course is logically a single course that builds on the first half.  Nevertheless, the material should be introductory and should be understandable given some prior study.</p>
