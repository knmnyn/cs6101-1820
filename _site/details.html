<h2>Registration FAQ</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>What are the pre-requisites?</strong> There are no formal prerequisites for the course.  As with many machine learning courses, it would be useful to have basic understanding of linear algebra in probability and statistics.  Taking online, open courses on these subjects concurrently or before the course would be advisable if you do not have to requisite understanding.</li>
  <li><strong>Is the course chargeable?</strong> <strong>No,</strong> the course is not chargeable.  It is free (as in no-fee).  NUS allows us to teach this course for free, as it is not “taught”, <em>per se</em>.  Students in the class take charge of the lectures, and complete a project, while the teaching staff facilitates the experience.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Can I get course credit for taking this?</strong> <strong>Yes,</strong> if you are a first-year School of Compu
ting doctoral student.  In this case you need to formally enroll in the course as CS6101, And you will receive one half of the 4-MC pass/fail credit that you would receive for the course, which is a lab rotation course.  Even though the left rotation is only for half the semester, such students are encouraged and welcome to complete the entire course.</p>

    <p><strong>No,</strong>  for everyone else.  By this we mean that no credits, certificate, or any other formal documentation for completing the course will be given to any other participants, inclusive of external registrants and NUS students (both internal and external to the School of Computing).  Such participants get the experience of learning deep learning together in a formal study group in developing the camaraderie and network from fellow peer students and the teaching staff.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>What are the requirements for completing the course?</strong> Each student must achieve 2 objectives  to be deemed to have completed the course:
    <ul>
      <li>Work with peers to assist in teaching two lecture sessions of the course: One lecture by co-lecturing the subject from new slides that you have prepared a team; and another lecture by moderating of the Slack channel to add materials for discussion.</li>
      <li>Complete a deep learning project. For the project, you only need to use any deep learning framework to execute a problem against a data set.  You may choose to replicate previous work orders in scientific papers or data science challenges. Or more challengingly, you may decide to use data from your own context.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>How do external participants take this course?</strong> You may come to
  NUS to participate in the lecture concurrently with all of our
  local participants.  You are also welcome to participate online
  through Google Hangouts.  We typically have a synchronous
  broadcast to Google Hangouts that is streamed and archived to
  YouTube.</p>

    <p>During the session where you’re responsible for co-lecturing, you
  will be expected to come to the class in person.</p>

    <p>As an external participant, you are obligated to complete the
  course to best your ability.  We do not encourage students who are
  not committed to completing the course to enrol.</p>
