This course is taken almost verbatim from [CS 294-112 Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/) -- [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/)'s course at UC Berkeley. We are following his course's formulation and selection of papers, with the permission of Levine.

This is a section of the CS 6101 Exploration of Computer Science Research at NUS. CS 6101 is a 4 modular credit pass/fail module for new incoming graduate programme students to obtain background in an area with an instructor's support. It is designed as a "lab rotation" to familiarize students with the methods and ways of research in a particular research area.

Our section will be conducted as a group seminar, with class participants nominating themselves and presenting the materials and leading the discussion. It is not a lecture-oriented course and not as in-depth as Levine's original course at UC Berkeley, and hence is not a replacement, but rather a class to spur local interest in Deep Reinforcement Learning.

This course is offered in Session I (Weeks 3-7) and Session II (Weeks 8-13), although it is clear that the course is logically a single course that builds on the first half.  Nevertheless, the material should be introductory and should be understandable given some prior study.
